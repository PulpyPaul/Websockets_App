# Websocket_Project


This project will be a small game. Essentially the goal of the game will be to click on
an object that matches the color the user is given. The object will randomly spawn
within the canvas and when the user correctly clicks on the right colored object they will
be given points.

For the prototype I add a ready system with the number of squares spawning according to the number
of users connected to the game. The next step will be color coding the squares so that the user
must match a color given to them with the colored object on the canvas.
