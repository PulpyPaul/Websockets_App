# Syncing_Data_2

This application is a small game.

Once all users ready up, a small red square will randomly spawn within the canvas and the user must click the square.
Once the square has been clicked, the user is rewarded 10 points and the square respawns.

CREATIVE & BEYOND

For going above and beyond I added a system to ready up. Rather than having the game start when the user loads the page
or hits a button, I thought it would be smart to force each user to hit the ready button to ensure they are prepared to play.
The number of users and number of user that still have to ready is displayed to everyone.
